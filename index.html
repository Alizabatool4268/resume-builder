            <p>
                As an aspiring web developer, my journey in the world of technology began in 2024<br>
                when I joined the GIAIC program, which focuses on Web 3.0 and the metaverse.<br>
                Since then, I have been actively developing my skills in frontend development,<br> 
                particularly in HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and Next.js. Currently, I am pursuing my<br>
                studies as a senior student at GIAIC, where I continue to expand my knowledge and<br>
                expertise through various milestone-based projects. This experience has not only <br>
                strengthened my technical abilities but also deepened my passion for building responsive<br> 
                and dynamic web applications.

                I am currently in my first year of studies, pursuing a medical <br>
                While my academic focus lies in the medical field, my passion for web development<br>
                has been a significant part of my personal and professional growth. My dedication<br> 
                to both disciplines showcases my adaptability and commitment to continuous learning.<br>
                In my matriculation, I successfully secured an A+ grade, reflecting my <br>
                strong academic foundation and drive for excellence.<br>

                As an aspiring web developer, I have dedicated myself to learning a range <br>
                of essential frontend technologies. I have gained proficiency in HTML,<br>
                CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript, which have provided me with a strong<br>
                foundation in creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.<br>
                Currently, I am enhancing my skill set by learning Next.js, a powerful <br>
                framework for building dynamic and interactive web pages. This ongoing <br>
                journey has allowed me to understand both static and dynamic web development,<br>
                and I am continuously expanding my knowledge to stay up-to-date with<br>
                modern industry practices.

                <article>
                    Though I am a fresher with no formal work experience, I have built several <br>
                    significant projects that demonstrate my technical skills, problem-solving<br>
                    abilities, and passion for web development:<br>
        
                    <br> <big>Command Line Calculator</big> <br>
                    This project is a functional, command-line-based calculator built using TypeScript <br>
                    and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with a focus <br>
                    on delivering a simple yet efficient user experience.Building this calculator<br>
                    helped me understand the fundamentals of programing.

                    <br> <big> Command Line Number Guessing Game</big> <br>
                    Designed an interactive number guessing game entirely based on command-line inputs. <br>
                    This game generates a random number, challenging users to guess it within a limited <br>
                    number of attempts. Through this project, I gained experience with control flow, <br>
                    randomization logic, and user interaction design, all of which improved my skills in <br>
                    building engaging user experiences.
        
                    <br> <big>E-Commerce Website</big> <br>
                    Developed a fully functional and responsive e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, <br>
                    and JavaScript. This website includes product listings, shopping cart functionalities,<br>
                    and checkout options. I focused on clean design and smooth user navigation.
